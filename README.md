## Julia

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a programming language geared for scientific
computing that is fast, dynamic, optionally typed, general, easy to use and
open source. This tap provides a "cask"-type of formula for Julia.

Since `brew` does not yet have support for Homebrew cask for Linux, this tap
provides a very installation that simply copies the pre-compiled Julia binaries
in the right place. This formula is only meant to be used in Linux.

## Emacs

A custom Emacs installation.

## NNN

A custom NNN installation.
