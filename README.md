# Homebrew Tap

Custom Homebrew formulae. Tap the repository: `brew tap gzagatti/tap`.

Available formulas:

- [Julia](#julia)
- [Potion](#potion)

## Julia

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a programming language geared for scientific
computing that is fast, dynamic, optionally typed, general, easy to use and
open source. This tap provides a "cask"-type of formula for Julia. 

Since `linuxbrew` does not yet have support for Homebrew cask, this tap
provides a very installation that simply copies the pre-compiled Julia binaries
in the right place. This formula is only meant to be used with `linuxbrew`.

## Potion

This formula installs a compiler for [`potion`](http://perl11.org/potion).
Although this is not currently maintained, it was created to
(1) to teach myself how to create a basic Homebrew formula; and (2) for
practicing the exercises in [Learn Vimscript the Hard
Way](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/).
